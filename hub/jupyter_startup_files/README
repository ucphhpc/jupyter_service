This directory is designated for scripts that are supposed to be copied by
`create_ipython_profile_start.py` into the default IPython profile startup directory.

When adding a script here, it should either be added to the swarm stack by
creating a specific docker-compose config entry for it and subsequently add it
to the global `c.SwarmSpawner.configs` option in the JupyterHub configuration file.
The configs will then be globally available on each node in the swarm cluster.

The other option is to bind mount the scripts, but this requires an external
distribution strategy because Docker Swarm doesn't implement this for bind or regular volumes.
